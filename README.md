# Educating success: Parental involvement and the formation of personality traits in children

Does parenting matter? Evidence on parenting and the formation of children's personality traits

In this analysis, we focus on how parental involvement is shaping personality characteristics, such as locus of control, conscientiousness and neuroticism, which are strong predictors of educational and labour market success. We assume that parents know which character traits benefit or harm their children and investigate whether parents are able to shape these traits in their children through more involvement, even without displaying these personality themselves. 

Our results indicate that a stronger parental involvement in the children's life has a positive effect on the personality traits that predict better outcomes. It also suggest that mothers and fathers might have different roles in the formation of the child's personality. For example, we find that the mother's involvement strongly increases locus of control while paternal involvement increases level of conscientiousness, while reducing neuroticism. 

This paper includes the description of our data from the The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the methodology and the result.
