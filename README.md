# Parenting and the formation of personality traits in children

Does parenting matter? Evidence on parenting and the formation of children's personality traits

In this analysis, we focus on how parental involvement is shaping personality characteristics, such as locus of control, conscientiousness and neuroticism, which are strong predictors of educational and labour market success. We assume that parents know what is best for their children and investigate whether parents are able to shape this traits in their children through more involvement, even without displaying these personality themselves.

Our results indicate that a stronger involvement of parents in the children's life has a positive effect on the personality traits that predict better outcomes. It also suggest that mothers and fathers might have different roles in the formation of the child's personality. We find that the mother's involvement strongly increases the locus of control trait while the involvement of the fathers increases level of conscientiousness, while reducing the neuroticism score.

This paper is included the description of our data which mainly obtained by the The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the methodology and the result for the research.
